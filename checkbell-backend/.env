To start the web application on a host, you need to ensure that the server is running and accessible. Based on the provided server.js file, you can start the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the directory where your server.js file is located.
2. Run the command: 

node backend/server.js

This will start the server on the specified port (4000). You can then access the application by navigating to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.

If you want to deploy this application to a different host or environment, you may need to adjust the environment variables and ensure that the server is accessible from that host.
