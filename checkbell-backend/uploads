To start the web application on a host, you need to ensure that the server is running and accessible. Based on the provided server.js file, the application is set to listen on port 4000. 

You can start the application by running the following command in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the directory where your server.js file is located.
2. Run the command: 

node backend/server.js

This will start the server, and you should see the message "✅ Server läuft auf http://127.0.0.1:4000" in your terminal, indicating that the server is running on localhost at port 4000.

If you want to access the application from a different host or IP address, you can modify the `httpServer.listen` line in your server.js file to listen on `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`. This will allow external connections:

httpServer.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`✅ Server läuft auf http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
});

After making this change, restart the server, and it will be accessible from other devices on the same network using your machine's IP address.
